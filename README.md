## Brief Description of Project
This project is based around a website which can be used to track lifting goals and weights which you have lifted. The primary focus for weights is bench press, deadlift, and squats as those are the main 3 exercises people reference when considering their gym progress.

## Design Work
Interview Results:

Q: What metrics are most important to you when it comes to gym progress?

A: the general concensus was that they were looking to see the increase over time of their weights as that is a very easy to see metric.

Q: how detailed would you want your tracking app/website to be?

A: both people had slightly different ideas on what details they would like, but the main idea was simplicity and they didn't want an 
overwhelming amount of data.

Q: how much time do you spend tracking your exercises and weights?

A: neither perrson currently used a tracking app for weight lifting, however one did use a calorie tracking app and values the ease of use in being able to quickly open the app, select a food and have the calories be tracked and simply displayed for the day.

From these interviews I gathered the idea of keeping the app as simple as possible which also inspired my simple mode button to keep it at maximum simplicity. I also decided on bench, squat, and deadlift for pr tracking to show gym progress which is prominently displayed on the screen.

Feedback: On my feedback I talked to a few people and we agreed that the calendar was a great idea as we could show day by day how consistent you've been at the gym, they also liked the progress bars and pr summary in the top right as its very obvious. They also really liked the bar idea with weights increasing with your pr, but I decided that would take too much time and I wouldn't be able to hit my other goals.


## Interface Details
Now to break into the interface. In the top left we display the user's name, the current date, the days they've tracked, and the length since they tracked their first day. I also put the buttons for some settings in the top right as well. There is the light mode/dark mode button to toggle coloring, the simple view/detailed view button which simplifies the inputs down to just whether or not you lifted as well as the past entries will only show a yes or no for whether you lifted that day. Finally there is the goal setting button which you can click to update your goals. The goal setting button will toggle a pane on the right side of the screen with buttons to update them.
