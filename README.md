## Brief Description of Project
This project is based around a website which can be used to track lifting goals and weights which you have lifted. The primary focus for weights is bench press, deadlift, and squats as those are the main 3 exercises people reference when considering their gym progress.

## Design Work
Interview Results:

Q: What metrics are most important to you when it comes to gym progress?

A: the general concensus was that they were looking to see the increase over time of their weights as that is a very easy to see metric.

Q: how detailed would you want your tracking app/website to be?

A: both people had slightly different ideas on what details they would like, but the main idea was simplicity and they didn't want an 
overwhelming amount of data.

Q: how much time do you spend tracking your exercises and weights?

A: neither perrson currently used a tracking app for weight lifting, however one did use a calorie tracking app and values the ease of use in being able to quickly open the app, select a food and have the calories be tracked and simply displayed for the day.

From these interviews I gathered the idea of keeping the app as simple as possible which also inspired my simple mode button to keep it at maximum simplicity. I also decided on bench, squat, and deadlift for pr tracking to show gym progress which is prominently displayed on the screen.
